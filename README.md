# Wolverine - Timeline Splitter

Wolverine is used to split sequences and animatics into shots, using ffmpeg and OpenTimelineIO. The point is to provide a timeline file (from all other formats supported by OTIO) or a video file and end using wolverine end up with separate shots (as video, audio et thumbnail files) as well as an .edl, an .xml and .otio files. The point being to have the split shots, tagged and able to be used as seprate resources in the pipeline as well as a timeline resources that can be viewed, updated and trasfered between the various software used in a pipeline.

This is very much an wip/early version and contains multiple bugs and still has a lot of missing features (working on it mostly in my free time), the code could also use a little clean up. Wolverine is currently also used at Brunch Studio where I work.
